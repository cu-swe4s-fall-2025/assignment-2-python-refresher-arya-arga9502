In this assignment, get_column function was developed that accesses and prints values from the desired column based on provided conditions.  For example, we wish to print the CO2 emissions values but only from a certain year or country. We can achieve this using the get_column function from my_utils package.

Then, a program called print_fires.py was written which calls the get_column function from the my_utils package and runs it on an example data set. We use the function to print forest fire information from the USA.

Finally, bash script run.sh was written to run the program print_fires.py.
